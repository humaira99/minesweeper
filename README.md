# Minesweeper
Minesweeper game in Java


- The game has a grid of buttons, which represent potential locations for mines.
- Initially all of the buttons blank/grey so you donâ€™t know whether they are mines
- You will click one at a time to try to find a mine.
- If you click on a mine then you lose.
- If you click on a non-mine then the square turns green tells you how many mines are immediately surrounding including diagonally.
- If you find a square with no mines around it then the game will automatically explore the surrounding (non-mine) squares for you, as if you have clicked on them.
- If you find all of the non-mine squares then you win.
